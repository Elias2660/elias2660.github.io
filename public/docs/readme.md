# My Personal Website

## Technologies

This is a `nextjs` application that is bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. There's other packages, that deal with markdown rendering (for the posts), but most of this stuff is pure next.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load `Inter`.
